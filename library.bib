abstract = {Variability modeling is one of the key disciplines in software product line engineering and has been addressed by academic and industrial research over the past twenty years. While the research community's focus was on creating notations and tools, most of which based on feature modeling, there are relatively few empirical studies that aim at understanding the actual use of these techniques. In this light, we present empirical work that investigates variability modeling in the context of software product lines. We study concepts and semantics of real-world variability languages and the usage of these concepts in real, large- scale variability models. We further extend our discussion to variability in software ecosystems, which target inter- organizational reuse and are often seen as natural successors of software product lines. We provide empirical evidence that the well-researched concepts of feature modeling are used in practice, but also that more advanced concepts are needed. We observe that some assumptions about realistic variability models in the literature do not hold. Further, our findings indicate that variability models are not suited for software ecosystems, and that particular kinds of dependencies are needed to enable growth of such ecosystems.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is starting to come into its own as a digital currency, but the blockchain technology behind it could prove to be much more significant. This book takes you beyond the currency (" Blockchain 1.0 ") and smart contracts (" Blockchain 2.0 ") to demonstrate how the blockchain is in position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking. Author Melanie Swan, Founder of the Institute for Blockchain Studies, explains that the blockchain is essentially a public ledger with potential as a worldwide, decentralized record for the registration, inventory, and transfer of all assets—not just finances, but property and intangible assets such as votes, software, health data, and ideas. Topics include: ■ Concepts, features, and functionality of Bitcoin and the blockchain ■ Using the blockchain for automated tracking of all digital endeavors ■ Enabling censorship-resistant organizational models ■ Creating a decentralized digital repository to verify identity ■ Possibility of cheaper, more efficient services traditionally provided by nations ■ Blockchain for science: making better use of the data-mining network ■ Personal health record storage, including access to one's own genomic data ■ Open access academic publishing on the blockchain This book is part of an ongoing O'Reilly series. Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies introduces Bitcoin and describes the technology behind Bitcoin and the blockchain. Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy considers the theoretical, philosophical, and societal impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.},

abstract = {Software factories have been proposed as a comprehensive and integrative approach to generative software develop-ment. Feature modeling has several applications in gen-erative software development, including domain analysis, product-line scoping, and feature-based product specifica-tion. This paper reports on our recent progress in cardinality-based feature modeling and its support for expressing ad-ditional constraints. We show that the Object-Constraint Language (OCL) can adequately capture such constraints. Furthermore, we identify a set of facilities based on con-straint satisfaction that can be provided by feature modeling and feature-based configuration tools and present a proto-type implementing some of these facilities. We report on our experience with the prototype and give directions for future work.},

@article{Sinnema2007,
abstract = {Variability modeling is important for managing variability in software product families, especially during product derivation. In the past few years, several variability modeling techniques have been developed, each using its own concepts to model the variability provided by a product family. The publications regarding these techniques were written from different viewpoints, use different examples, and rely on a different technical background. This paper sheds light on the similarities and differences between six variability modeling techniques, by exemplifying the techniques with one running example, and classifying them using a framework of key characteristics for variability modeling. It furthermore discusses the relation between differences among those techniques, and the scope, size, and application domain of product families. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Chemical category is a regulatory concept facilitating filling safety data gaps. Practically, all chemical management programs like the OECD HPV Program, EU REACH, or the Canadian DSL Categorization are planning to use or are already using categorization approaches to reduce resources including animal testing. The aim of the study was to discuss the feasibility to apply computational structural similarity methods to augment formation of a category. The article discusses also how this understanding can be translated into computer readable format, an ultimate need for practical, broad scope applications. We conclude that for the skin sensitization endpoint, used as a working example, mechanistic understanding expressed as chemical reactivity can be exploited by computational structural similarity methods to augment category formation process. We propose a novel method, atom environments ranking (AER), to assess similarity to a reference training set representing a common mechanism of action, as a potential method for grouping chemicals into reactivity domains.},

@unpublished{Nakamoto2008,
abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
