abstract = {â€”The current environment of web applications demands performance and scalability. Several previous approaches have implemented threading, events, or both, but increasing traffic requires new solutions for improved concurrent service. Node.js is a new web framework that achieves both through server-side JavaScript and event-driven I/O. Tests will be performed against two comparable frameworks that compare service request times over a number of cores. The results will demonstrate the per-formance of JavaScript as a server-side language and the efficiency of the non-blocking asynchronous model.},

abstract = {Variability modeling is essential for defining and managing the commonalities and variabilities in software product lines. Numer-ous variability modeling approaches exist today to support domain and application engineering activities. Most are based on feature modeling (FM) or decision modeling (DM), but so far no system-atic comparison exists between these two major classes of approaches. Over the last two decades many new features have been added to both FM and DM and it is tough to decide which approach to use for what purpose. This paper clarifies the relation between FM and DM. We aim to systematize the research field of variability mod-eling and to explore potential synergies. We compare multiple as-pects of FM and DM ranging from historical origins and rationale, through syntactic and semantic richness, to tool support, identify-ing commonalities and differences. We hope that this effort will improve the understanding of the range of approaches to variabil-ity modeling by discussing the possible variations. This will pro-vide insights to users considering adopting variability modeling in practice and to designers of new languages, such as the new OMG Common Variability Language.},

Overwriting other methods is viewed as resolving feature interactions and is speciied sep-arately for two features at a time. This programming model allows to compose features (almost) freely in a way which generalizes inheritance and aggregation. For a set of n features, an exponential number of dif-ferent feature combinations is possible, assuming a quadratic number of interaction resolutions. We present the feature model as an extension of Java and give two translations to Java, one via inheritance and the other via aggregation. We further discuss parameterized features, which work nicely with our feature model and can be translated into Pizza, an extension of Java.},

Practically, all chemical management programs like the OECD HPV Program, EU REACH, or the Canadian DSL Categorization are planning to use or are already using categorization approaches to reduce resources including animal testing. The aim of the study was to discuss the feasibility to apply computational structural similarity methods to augment formation of a category. The article discusses also how this understanding can be translated into computer readable format, an ultimate need for practical, broad scope applications. We conclude that for the skin sensitization endpoint, used as a working example, mechanistic understanding expressed as chemical reactivity can be exploited by computational structural similarity methods to augment category formation process. We propose a novel method, atom environments ranking (AER), to assess similarity to a reference training set representing a common mechanism of action, as a potential method for grouping chemicals into reactivity domains.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

This book takes you beyond the currency (" Blockchain 1.0 ") and smart contracts (" Blockchain 2.0 ") to demonstrate how the blockchain is in position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking. Author Melanie Swan, Founder of the Institute for Blockchain Studies, explains that the blockchain is essentially a public ledger with potential as a worldwide, decentralized record for the registration, inventory, and transfer of all assetsâ€”not just finances, but property and intangible assets such as votes, software, health data, and ideas. Topics include: â–  Concepts, features, and functionality of Bitcoin and the blockchain â–  Using the blockchain for automated tracking of all digital endeavors â–  Enabling censorship-resistant organizational models â–  Creating a decentralized digital repository to verify identity â–  Possibility of cheaper, more efficient services traditionally provided by nations â–  Blockchain for science: making better use of the data-mining network â–  Personal health record storage, including access to one's own genomic data â–  Open access academic publishing on the blockchain This book is part of an ongoing O'Reilly series.

@unpublished{Buterin2014,
abstract = {When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was simultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the "bitcoin", a decentralized peer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any backing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So far, the "bitcoin" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi's grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized digital currency. Satoshi's blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin's technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money. Commonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin") as well as more advanced applications such as decentralized exchange, financial derivatives, peer-to-peer gambling and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is "smart contracts" -systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract of the form "A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together can withdraw anything, and A can shut off B's ability to withdraw". The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) -long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and encode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

@article{Catalini2018,
abstract = {This paper explores how entrepreneurs can use initial coin offerings â€” whereby they issue crypto tokens and commit to accept only those tokens as payment for future use of a digital platform â€” to fund venture start-up costs. We show that the ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, which, in turn, reveals consumer value without the entrepreneurs having to know, ex ante, consumer willingness to pay. We find that venture returns are independent of any committed growth in the supply of tokens over time, but that initial funds raised are maximized by setting that growth to zero to encourage saving by early participants. Furthermore, by revealing key aspects of consumer demand, crypto tokens may increase entrepreneurial returns beyond what can be achieved through traditional equity financing. A lack of commitment in monetary policy can, however, undermine saving and, thus, the cost of using tokens to fund start-up costs is potential inflexibility in future capital raising. Crypto tokens can also facilitate coordination among stakeholders within digital ecosystems when network effects are present. JEL Classification Numbers: E42, L12, L26.},

@article{Thelwall2001,
abstract = {The content of the web has increasingly become a focus for academic research. Computer programs are needed in order to conduct any large-scale processing of web pages, requiring the use of a web crawler at some stage in order to fetch the pages to be analysed. The processing of the text of web pages in order to extract information can be expensive in terms of processor time. Consequently a distributed design is pro-posed in order to effectively use idle computing resources and to help information scientists avoid the need to employ dedicated equipment. A system developed using the model is examined and the advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Czarnecki2004,
abstract = {Feature modeling is an important approach to capturing commonalities and variabilities in system families and product lines. In this paper, we propose a cardinality-based notation for feature modeling, which integrates a number of existing extensions of previous approaches. We then introduce and motivate the novel concept of staged configura-tion. Staged configuration can be achieved by the stepwise specialization of feature models. This is important because in a realistic development process, different groups and different people eliminate product variabil-ity in different stages. We also indicate how cardinality-based feature models and their specialization can be given a precise formal semantics.},
